  utter_cut:
  - text: "First, clean the cut thoroughly to prevent infection, then apply pressure for 1-2 minutes until the bleeding stops. Next, gently apply Petroleum Jelly to keep the wound moist for faster healing. Finally, cover the cut with a sterile bandage. If you're experiencing discomfort,
   you can also consider using pain relievers such as acetaminophen."

  utter_Abrasions:
  - text: "Start by ensuring your hands are clean. Gently cleanse the area using cool to lukewarm water and a mild soap. If there are any foreign particles, carefully remove them with sanitized tweezers. For minor scrapes that aren't bleeding, it's fine to leave the wound uncovered. If there's bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or bandage until it stops. Once bleeding has ceased, cover the area with a thin layer of topical antibiotic ointment, such as Bacitracin, or a sterile moisture barrier ointment like Aquaphor, and then use a clean bandage or gauze. Remember to cleanse the wound and change the ointment and bandage daily. Keep an eye on the area for any signs of infection, such as pain, redness, or swelling,
   and consult your doctor if you suspect an infection."


  utter_stings:
  - text: "Begin by removing any stingers promptly. Some experts suggest using a credit card to scrape out the stinger. To alleviate discomfort, applying ice to the site can offer mild relief. Apply ice for 20 minutes once every hour as necessary, but remember to wrap the ice in a towel or place a cloth between the ice and skin to prevent freezing. Taking an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or a non-sedating one like loratadine (Claritin) can help alleviate itching and swelling. For pain relief, you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin) as needed. Afterward, wash the sting site with soap and water. Additionally,
   applying hydrocortisone cream to the sting can help alleviate redness, itching, and swelling."

  utter_Splinter:
  - text: "1. SOAK IN EPSOM SALTS: Dissolve a cup of Epsom salts into a warm bath and soak the affected area. Alternatively, you can apply some of the salts onto a bandage pad and cover the splinter for a day; this method can help bring the splinter to the surface.
2. VINEGAR OR OIL: Another effective method is to soak the affected area in oil (such as olive or corn) or white vinegar. Simply pour some into a bowl and soak the area for approximately 20 to 30 minutes."

  utter_Sprains:
  - text: "Use an ice pack or ice slush bath immediately for 15 to 20 minutes and repeat every two to three hours while you're awake.
     To help stop swelling, compress the ankle with an elastic bandage until the swelling stops.
      In most cases, pain relievers â€” such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) are enough to manage the pain of a sprained ankle."

  utter_Strains:
  - text: "Rest,Ice,Compression and Elevation can be used to cure strains. Avoid using your muscle for a few days,
         especially if movement causes an increase in pain and also Apply ice immediately after injuring your muscle.
          This will minimize swelling. Donâ€™t put ice directly on your skin. Use an ice pack or wrap ice in a towel. 
        To reduce swelling, wrap the affected area with an elastic bandage until swelling comes down."

  utter_Gastrointestinal_problems:

  unless specified by a medical professional.3)Taking antacids may help, per recommendation of a healthcare professional.

  utter_Bruises:

  3)Repeat several times a day for a day or two as needed. 
  4)Compress the bruised area if it is swelling, using an elastic bandage. "

  utter_Broken_Toe:
  - text: "1)To help decrease pain and swelling in a broken toe, elevate the foot, ice the injury, and stay off the foot.
   2)Depending on the severity of the fracture, the toe may need to be put back into place (reduced), and some compound toe fractures may require surgery.
  3) Most broken toes heal without complications in six weeks."

  utter_Choking:

  3)If coughing doesn't work, start back blows and Abdonominal thrusts"

  utter_nose_bleed:
  - text: "Gently blow your nose to clear any blood clots.
         Spray a nasal decongestant such as oxymetazoline in both nostrils, if available.
         Pinch the soft part of your nose below the bridge for 10 minutes non-stop, and lean slightly forward.
         Breathe through your mouth and spit out any blood that enters your mouth.
         Once the bleeding has stopped, do not touch or blow your nose again."

  utter_Fracture:

    a clean cloth or a clean piece of clothing. 2)Immobilize the injured area.
    Don't try to realign the bone or push a bone that's sticking out back in.
     If you've been trained in how to splint and professional help isn't readily available,
      apply a splint to the area above and below the fracture sites. Padding the splints can help reduce discomfort.
       3)Apply ice packs to limit swelling and help relieve pain. Don't apply ice directly to the skin.
        Wrap the ice in a towel, piece of cloth or some other material. 4)Treat for shock.
         If the person feels faint or is breathing in short, rapid breaths, lay the person down with the head slightly lower than the trunk and, 
       if possible, elevate the legs."
